Implement the ability to cancel a booking

a: Create an /DELETE endpoint to handle booking cancellation request( by bookingId )
d: Check if the booking can be canceled;
   Note: you need to check if the Booking can be canceled, and also status of the room should be BOOKED
   if this above fails throw EntityNotFoundException
c: Implement the business logic to cancel a booking(update booking status) and update room status.
d: Save booking and room with updated status fields in a single transaction
e: convert booking to dto
f: return response

Additional task:
should we refactor BookingService class?
