1.  Grenerate  new maven project using mvn archetype:generate command with archetype template maven-archetype-quickstart - mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart
2.  Configure maven.compiler.source and maven.compiler.target to desired version of Java
 <properties>
    <maven.compiler.source>21</maven.compiler.source>
    <maven.compiler.target>21</maven.compiler.target>
  </properties>
3.  Generate two more projects and make them child projects to the first one 
 <parent>
    <groupId>XXX</groupId>
    <artifactId>XXX</artifactId>
    <version>XXX</version>
  </parent>
4.  Play around with the dependencies, change the version of junit in child projects or in parent and check dependency tree to see the changes - mvn dependency:tree
5.  Add new dependency of your choice in <dependencyManagement> section in parent app
6.  Play around with the new dependencies, change the version of it in child projects and check dependency tree to see the changes
7.  Add version range for dependency and check the dependency tree
8.  Generate another projects, add new dependency of your choice and make it optional
9.  Add newly created project as a dependency to the parent
10. Check the dependency tree of parent project to see what happens
11. Add maven wrapper to one of the child projects
12. Create maven project that can convert json to yaml and vice-versa:
      * you can use any library you want - in case you don't know any we suggest gson and snakeyaml
      * resulting jar can be ran with following command
        java -jar my_code.jar arg1 arg2
      * arguments (arg1 and arg2) can be one of these:
        ** -j 'my json string'
        ** -y 'my yaml string'
        ** -jf my_json_file
        ** -yf my_yaml_file
